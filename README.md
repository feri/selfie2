## Selfie2

Selfie2 is uMEC demo application for showing how simple web apps can implement
uMEC APIs, in this case an object detection API. 

A live demo of the app can be found at: https://micromec.org/hack/feri_selfie2

When loading the demo page, the browser will open the camera of the device. By
tapping or clicking the image the picture will be sent to a backend which is 
based on the Tensorflow Predict API.

The backend will predict the objects that can found in the captured image.
